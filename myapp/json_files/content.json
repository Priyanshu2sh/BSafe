      "question": "What is working at height?",
      "answer": "Working at height refers to any task where there is a risk of falling from one level to another, which could cause injury. This includes working above ground/floor level, near edges/openings, or fragile surfaces. There is no minimum height threshold—any potential fall hazard qualifies.",

      "question": "How can I eliminate the need to work at height?",
      "answer": "Elimination is the top priority in the Hierarchy of Controls. Methods include using extendable tools from the ground, lowering equipment for repairs, covering floor holes, or installing fixed platforms. Always consult your Line Manager to explore alternatives.",

      "answer": "The Hierarchy of Controls (HOC) prioritizes safety measures in this order: 1) Elimination, 2) Substitution, 3) Engineering controls (e.g., guardrails, MEWPs), 4) Administrative controls (training, PTW), and 5) PPE (last resort). Always apply these steps sequentially.",

      "answer": "PPE for fall protection follows the 'ABC' system: Anchorages, Body support (harnesses), Connecting devices (lanyards), Descent/rescue equipment, Education, and Fall protection for tools. PPE must be inspected and used only after other HOC steps are exhausted.",
